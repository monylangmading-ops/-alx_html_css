# Project-1: Advanced HTML Practice

This project is part of my journey in learning **advanced HTML concepts**.
It includes a simple webpage structure with a header, navigation, sections, footer, and icons.

## Features

* Semantic HTML5 structure (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`)
* Responsive navigation bar
* Footer with icons and links
* Sample images and placeholders to simulate a real website

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   ```
2. Open the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Project-1
   ```
3. Launch `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

* You can use this as a template for personal projects.
* Replace the sample images and text with your own content.
